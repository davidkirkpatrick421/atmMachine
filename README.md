# --- ATMMachine Java Project ---

*Updated Nov 25*

This is a simulated ATM bank machine, developed in Java, as part of my M.Sc. Software Development degree course.

It was previously created in class, but I'm now using it to test my CI/CD linux server
pipeline. I will be adding further revisions to the program using git control and developing the ATM as I learn more in
the Java programming module.

**Live demo:** (***Coming Soon***)

Default PIN is 1234.

### **Current Features**

- User PIN authentication (hardcoded for now)
- Security: 3-attempt limit on PIN entry
- Basic menu system with repeating menu loop
- Balance checking
- Deposit/withdrawal (if you have these)

### **Future Implementations**

- Refactoring and setup of better OOP design.
- Encapsulation of classes and methods like PIN auth for security.
- More robust error handling.
- Adding arrayList for transaction history? or other relevant data.
- Consider ways of implementing a GUI and improving the user experience (arrow keys to navigate, etc.)
- Consider how to integrate with a database.
