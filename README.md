---ATMMachine Java Project---

This is a simulated ATM bank machine, developed in Java, as part of my M.Sc. Software Development degree course.

12/11/25 - This is the first commit. It was previously created, but I'm now using it to test my CI/CD linux server
pipeline. I will be adding further revisions to the program using git control and developing the ATM as I learn more in
the Java programming module.
